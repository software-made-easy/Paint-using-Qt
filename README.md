# Paint-using-Qt
Paint is a simple tool for draw images.

## Installation

### Windows

*Now avaiable in releases*

### Linux

In Releas you will find a executable for x86_64/arm64

### Mac/iPhone

I donâ€™t own a Mac, so I cant make an executable for it. For the time being Mac users will have to compile the application from source.

### Android

Take a look at [releases](https://github.com/software-made-easy/Paint-using-Qt/releases/latest).
